# Mark VandeWettering branding iron design

Years ago I was doing some woodworking, and thought it would be cool to create
a branding iron so I could mark my creations (crude as they were) with my identity.
I then tinkered together an OpenSCAD version of a simple 1" diameter brand
consisting of my initials.  That original openscad file was lost to time,
but I have sense recreated the logo using OnShape.  

Now, in 2025, I am beginning to be able to use my own CNC machine, and decided
that a simple dxf version of the logo would be cool to have stashed somewhere.
Here is the straight export of that DXF from onshape.

Early experimentation shows there may be insufficient spacing between the V and
W to make milling with a standard 1/8" bit.  Even scaled to 100mm in diameter,
the gap may be smaller than 1/8".  I might seek to modify it slightly to make 
it more straighforward to cut.
